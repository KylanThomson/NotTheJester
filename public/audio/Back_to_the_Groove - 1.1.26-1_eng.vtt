00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:22.060
[instruments]

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:27.060
Didn't you just say

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.060
Nothing left but bills to pay

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:37.060
So the story goes

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:43.800
Time will fly, reap and sow

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.900
Nothing left to pardon

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:53.800
Nothing left but the truth

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.400
Sideways and find ways

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.400
To get me back home

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:07.100
Back home to the groove.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.800
Different kind of faith

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.800
One where you convince yourself its not too late

00:01:16.800--> 00:01:20.800
Thinking 'bout what went wrong

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:26.800
See it in yesterday's mourning song

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.300
Nothing left to pardon

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.600
Nothing left but the truth

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.100
Sideways and find ways

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.800
To get me back home

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:51.800
Back home to the groove.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.100
What if I could spare,

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.800 
Something left you do not dare

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.800 
Wonder what was right

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:33.800
All those answers in the dark of night

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.200
Nothing left to pardon

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.800
Nothing left but the truth

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.100
Sideways and find ways

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.900
To get me back home

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.900
Back home to the groove.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.900
Back home to the groove.
