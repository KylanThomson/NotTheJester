cue-2
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.340
There are forms they take offense to me.

cue-3
00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.740
Well, there's nothing left, nothing left
to see.

cue-4
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.620
-To see.
-By and large, they have come to be

cue-5
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.300
diamonds in the sands of a sea.

cue-6
00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.980
So we're sailing

cue-7
00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.080
away,

cue-8
00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.700

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.100
Sideways bends the path of all,

cue-13
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.340
-with butterflies petrified in gold.
-In gold.

cue-14
00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.080
With nothing real, nothing can unfold,

cue-15
00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:29.080
when we're petrified, petrified in gold.

cue-16
00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.860

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.660

-Like buffalo running, running free.
-Running free.

cue-22
00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.720
Some would say we're better off to flee.

cue-23
00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.060
Others say they'd rather not compete.

cue-24
00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.860
We're sailing on

cue-25
00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:32.540
the sea will set us free. So we're
sailing
